# PAWSim: Parachute and wind tunnel simulator

Not only will this project have a positive impact on the environment by reducing fuel consumption, it will also improve the quality of life for communities living near the airport. By minimizing the amount of noise pollution caused by general aviation, residents will be able to enjoy a quieter and more peaceful environment.
