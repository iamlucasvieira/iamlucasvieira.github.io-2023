Growing up next to a military airbase was like going to an airshow everyday. I would look up and see airplanes slicing through the sky, releasing skydivers who looked like tiny toy figures. But the highlight of each year was the annual airshow. One [particular act](https://youtu.be/r5s6qrj3RLE?si=DYOu-OrdxxjVWbqw&t=78) always fascinated me: a pilot would simulate a loss of control and spiral towards the Earth in a dizzying descent, only to regain control and soar back into the sky when it seemed too late. This experience ignited my passion for aviation and set me on a course to become an Aerospace Engineer. 

Aside from my aerospace studies, I have always worked on coding projects. It all began with the classic "Hello, World!" script, and since then, I have never stopped programming. The project I am most proud of is the [AI autopilot]({% link _projects/2023-07-01-safe-autopilot.md %})  system I developed for my thesis. Working on these coding projects made me realise that programming wasn't just a hobby but an extension of my engineering mindset. It became my favourite way to use my creativity to solve problems. 

When I'm not elbows-deep in code or aerospace research, you'll likely find me lost in a book, levelling up in a video game, or strategising over a board game. Like that pilot who captures everyone's attention with a last-minute recovery, I enjoy turning challenges into opportunities. Whether in aerospace or programming, the real showstopper isn't just about flying high; it's about understanding the dynamics so well that you make the impossible look easy.
