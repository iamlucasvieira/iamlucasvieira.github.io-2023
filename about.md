Growing up next to a military airbase was like having a front-row seat to a continuous airshow. Every day I'd look up to see airplanes slicing through the sky, releasing skydivers who looked like tiny toy figures. But the high point of each year was the annual airshow, where [one act](https://youtu.be/r5s6qrj3RLE?si=DYOu-OrdxxjVWbqw&t=78) always fascinated me: A pilot simulating a loss of control and spiralling towards Earth in a dizzying descent. Just when it seemed too late, they'd regain control and soar back into the sky. This ignited a love for aviation and set me on a course to become an Aerospace Engineer.

Parallel to my aerospace studies, I always had a coding project in the works. I began with the typical "Hello, World!", but over time, the projects grew in complexity and ambition - most notably, an [AI autopilot](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A10f5fa68-f934-414a-9067-988f51f098cb?collection=education) system for my thesis. And the more I coded, the more I realised that programming wasn't just a hobbyâ€”it was an extension of my engineering dreams, a canvas for my creativity and problem-solving skills.

When I'm not elbows-deep in code or aerospace research, you're likely to find me lost in a book, levelling up in a video game, or strategising over a board game. It's this blend of interests and experiences that fuels me, both as a person and as a professional. Just like that pilot who captures everyone's attention with a last-minute recovery, I find thrill in turning challenges into opportunities. Whether it's in aerospace or programming, the real spectacle isn't just about flying high; it's about understanding the dynamics so well that you make the impossible look easy.
